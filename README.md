# klsmith/remote-file-sync

A Docker utility to perform a one-way file sync from a remote server (SFTP or SSH) to a local filesystem, with support for multiple source-destination pairs.

## Usage

There are several ways to run `klsmith/remote-file-sync`.

Regardless how you run it, be sure to mount a host volume at `/dest` so the files persist after the container shuts down.

Stand-alone:

```
docker run --privileged -v /path/to/docker/volume:/dest \
    -e HOST=sourcehost.example.com \
    -e USER=remote_user \
    -e PASS=remote_user_pass \
    -e SYNC_1_SRC=wordress/wp-content/uploads/ \
    -e SYNC_1_DEST=uploads/ \
    -e SYNC_2_SRC=path/to/another/uploads/folder/ \
    -e SYNC_2_DEST=second/uploads/destination/ \
    -e DEST_DIR_PERMS=755 \
    -e DEST_FILE_PERMS=644 \
    -e DEST_GROUP=www-data \
    -e DEST_USER=www-data \
    klsmith/remote-file-sync
```

Docker Compose:

```
version: '2'

services:
  file-sync:
    image: 'klsmith/remote-file-sync:latest'
    environment:
      - HOST=sourcehost.example.com
      - USER=remote_user
      - PASS=remote_user_pass
      - SYNC_1_SRC=wordress/wp-content/uploads/
      - SYNC_1_DEST=uploads/
      - SYNC_2_SRC=path/to/another/uploads/folder/
      - SYNC_2_DEST=second/uploads/destination/
      - DEST_DIR_PERMS=755
      - DEST_FILE_PERMS=644
      - DEST_GROUP=www-data
      - DEST_USER=www-data
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/docker/volume:/dest'
```

### Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Required? | Description |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| HOST | Yes | Remote server's hostname. |
| USER | Yes | Username to connect to remote server. |
| PASS |  | Password to connect to remote server. Required if `IDENTITY_FILE` is not set. |
| IDENTITY_FILE |  | Path to private key for authenticating with remote server. Required if `PASS` is not set. e.g. `/path/to/id_rsa` |
| REMOTE_PATH |  | Default: `~` |
| SYNC_#_SRC | Yes | Remote source path, where # is a positive integer. At least one (`SYNC_1_SRC`) is required. e.g. `wordpress/wp-content/uploads/` |
| SYNC_#_DEST | Yes | Local destination path, where # is a positive integer. At least one (`SYNC_1_DEST`) is required. e.g. `uploads/`, which means destination files will be located in the container at `/dest/uploads/`. You should mount a host volume at `/dest` in order for the files to persist after the container shuts down. |
| DEST_DIR_PERMS |  | Sets Unix permissions on destination directories. e.g. `755` |
| DEST_FILE_PERMS |  | Sets Unix permissions on destination files. e.g. `644` |
| DEST_USER |  | Sets the owner on all destination files and directories. e.g. `www-data` |
| DEST_GROUP |  | Sets the group on all destination files and directories. e.g. `www-data` Requires `DEST_USER` to be set. |

The container will exit with code 0 when the sync finishes.
